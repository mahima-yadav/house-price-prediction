# House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains a simple House Price Prediction model implemented using Python. The project follows a structured process, including data cleaning, model development using Ridge regression.

Key Components
## Data Cleaning: The model utilizes a dataset from Kaggle (Seattle House Price Prediction). The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, categorical data, and other preprocessing steps.

## Model Development: The machine learning model is implemented using Ridge regression, leveraging the scikit-learn library. The trained model is saved for later use.
